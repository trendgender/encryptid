		<h1>WHAT IF FRANKENSTEIN AND HIS MONSTER WERE ACTUALLY THE SAME CREATURE // I FEEL MOST LIKE A FAGGOT RIGHT BEFORE I AM CAUGHT</h1>
		<p><b><i>I.</i></b>
		    <br>my monster's body
		<br>can either mean my body [<i>OWNS</i>] a monster
		<br>or my body [<i>IS</i>] a monster 
		<br><br>
		<b><i>II.</i></b>
		<br>
		sometimes i want to leave my skin in one of the terrific and dangerous ways other transsexuals do
		<br><br>
		<b><i>III.</b></i>
		<br>so i am reading the blog of someone who is transitioning back to their birth gender 
		<br>after dysphoria in both binaries / and they say 
		<br><i>i can’t look at myself anymore</i> & 
		<br><i>i feel like a</i> freak | <i>monstrous | <b>frankensteined</b></i>
		<br>
		<br>and there is no binary that could convince me to pray 
		<br>to it but the creature that lives shuttered against 
		<br>the wall of my chest hears something familiar and
		<br> rears its malform | <i>monstrous | <b>miscreation</b></i>
		<br><br>
		<b><i>IV.</b></i>
		<br>in the supermarket some child always shrieked stickily to their discontent adult 
	<br><br><i>IS THAT A BOY | OR A GIRL</i>
<br><br>at first i’d hide in the next aisle to break into some kind of shamed sob
<br>then i’d sneer back at whichever newly-toothed mouth the question came from
	<br><br><i>WHAT IF I’M NEITHER
	<br>WHAT IF I’M BOTH
	<br>WHAT IF I’M NOTHING
	<br>WHAT IF I’M LEAVING
	<br>WHAT IF I’M GONE</i>
	<br><br>
	<b><i>V.</b></i>
	<br>after i get top surgery, my lover visits me
	<br>in recovery & holds my hand & when my bandages
	<br>come off, he 
	<br>leaves. 
	<br><br>
	<b><i>VI.</b></i>
	<br>
	i flinch when i drive through intersections because 
<br>my body remembers a car accident it survived
<br><br>(my body remembers it did not have a limp prior)
<br><br>i flinch when i see myself in the mirror because
<br>my body remembers a sloppy surgery it survived
<br><br>(my body remembers what grew there before it was un-grown)
<br><br>i flinch when you say <i>u know i love u right? </i>because
<br>my body doesn’t remember a love that it survived
<br><br>
<b><i>VII.</b></i>
<br>i wonder how many years it will take of me stumbling over the prayer following another confident voice before i remember the cadence of community as smoothly as i do the threat of christianity
<br>/ what wonder / a prayer my abusers never memorized / an altar i wasn’t molested behind / a religious service i didn’t spend just as long trying to scrub off /
<br><br>
<b><i>VIII.</b></i>
<br>i am spending chanukah reading a historical account of anti-semitism<br>
<br>a blonde boy with blue eyes is still a jew if he’s born a jew<br>
<br>my father went to catholic school and they tried to beat the jew out of him
<br><br>
<b><i>IX.</b></i>
<br>what is a jew 
<br>but an anxiety
<br>growing sourly
<br>ashamed of itself
<br><br>
<b><i>X.</b></i>
<br>the borders are closed so we video-chat across time-zones
<br>our voices crackle like glass breaking
<br>last year i set my curtains on fire waiting for the light to 
<br>(((fade)))
<br><br>
<b><i>XI.</b></i>
<br><b>what do leftists dream about?</b> 
<br><i>cop cars on fire | being arrested
<br>being loved | lovers being arrested
<br>setting cop cars on fire with lovers</i>
<br><br>
<b><i>XII.</i></b>
<br>someone else's meatsuit && i are making out on their couch
<br>instead of moving like dreams our sweat congeals && we laugh
<br>i move to choke her like the faggots we are 
<br>&& i wake up, caught mid---------------
